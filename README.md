Steering Law experiment
=======================

Description
-----------

Steering law experiment implemented in MATLAB using PTB.  The .m files are standalone experiments that output data into the ./data/ subdirectory in .csv format.

CurveSteeringLaw.m
------------------

Produces curved paths that participants must traverse using mouse pointer or finger (in the case of touchscreens)

RadialSteeringLaw.m
-------------------

Similar to Fitts.m (see my other repository, af-fitts), presents linear paths as near-diametric chords that zig-zag across a circular arrangement of end-points that participants must traverse using mouse pointer or finger.
